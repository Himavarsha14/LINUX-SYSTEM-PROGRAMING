## 1.Why we are using pthread_create instead of clone() for creating threads?
- The arguments of clone() are complex because its a low level system call that requires you to explicitly provide things like the function pointer,child stack,flags, and optional TLS/pid/cgroup info.
- Thats why we usually use pthread_create(), which hides this complexity and provides a simpler,standardized interface.

## 2.Why a stack grows?
A stack grows because each function call needs its own space to keep track of execution.
- When a function is called, the system pushes a stack frame onto the stack, storing local variables,return address, and function parameters.
- When the function returns, its stack frame is popped, and control goes back to the caller.

## 3.Can you fetch the thread entry point return value in your main thread?
Yes,In POSIX threads,you can fetch the return value of a thread in the main thread using pthread_join().
- The thread's entry function returns a void*.
- When you call pthread_join(thread_id, &retval);,the pointer retval will hold the return value.
  
- Example:
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>

void* thread_func(void* arg) {
    int *result = malloc(sizeof(int));  
    *result = 10 + 20;                 
    return result;                     
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    void *retval;

    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, thread_func, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, &retval);

    printf("Thread returned: %d\n", *(int*)retval);

    free(retval); // free the allocated memory
    return 0;
}
```
## 4.What segments are shared by multiple threads within a process?
- 1.Code/Text Segment:Instructions of the program.
- 2.Data Segment(global & statc variables).
- 3.Heap Segment-dynamically allocated memory(malloc).
- 4.File descriptors and other OS resource.

## 5.what happens when main function is invoked?
- When a C program starts,the OS loader loads it into memory,stes up the stack, heap  and data segments, and passes command-line arguments and environment variables.The C runtime(_start) initializes the program and then calls main().
- After main() finishes,its return value is sent to the OS as the programs's exit status,and cleanup is performed.

## 6.What happens when cpu stops executing.
- When the CPU stops executing instructions, it either enters a halt/idle state waiting for interrupts (program or system idle) or completely stops on shutdown, while the OS handles cleanup of processes and resources.

## 7.During the context switch, which instruction will be usedto copy the contents of cpu register to your context area of PCB?
- During a context switch, the CPU registers are saved to the PCB using PUSH instructions, and restored later using POP instructions.

## 8.How do you create separate process?
- A new process is created using the fork() system call, which duplicates the parent process; the child process often uses exec() to run a different program.

## 9.How do server create seperate process?
- A server typically uses the fork() system call after accepting a client connection. The child process handles the client request, while the parent process continues listening for new connections.

## 10.Advantage of Thread over process
- Lightweight:Threads share the same address space, so less overhead than processes.
- Faster communication:Threads can easily share data without IPC.
- Less resource usage:Threads do not require separate memory allocation like processes.
- Better performance:Thread creation, switching, and termination are faster than processes.
- Parallelism:Multiple threads can perform tasks simultaneously, improving CPU utilization.

## 11.Advantage of process over thread
- Isolation:Each process has its own address space, so a crash is one process doesn't affect others.
- Security:Processses can't easily corrupt each other's data.
- Stabilty:Bugs in one process dont bring down the whole application.
- Better fault tolerance:Easier to manage failures in separate processes.\

## 12.How to overcome synchronization issues with global variables when multiple threads access them?
- Use synchronization mechanisms:
  - Mutex locks- to allow only one thread at a time.
  - Semaphores- for controlling access count.
  - Spinlocks/Condition variables- for more advanced synchronization.
  - Atomic operations-for simple shared data.
- Protect the critical section properly to avoid race conditions.

## 13.How much CPU time is given to user space thread and kernel space thread?
- User-space threads:Scheduled by the user-level thread library, CPU time depends on how the user scheduler runs them.
- Kernal-space threads:Scheduled by the OS kernal, CPU time is allocated like normal processes.
In short, user-level threads depend on user scheduler time slicing, whereas kernal-level threads depend on kernal scheduler.

## 14.POSIX vs SYSTEM V

## 14.Points to remember when mutex locks are used to protect critical section.
- Always initialize the mutex before use.
- Always lock before entering critical section.
- Always unlock after leaving critical section.
- Avoid deadlocks(e.g., by locking in consistent order).
- Check return values of mutex functions.
- Never access shared data outside the lock.

## 15.By using mutex_lock what you are achieving?
- You ensure mutual exclusion- only one thread can access the critical section at a time.
- Prevent race conditions and data corruption.
- Provide thread synchronization and consistency of shared resources.

## 16.Difference between Mutex locks and semaphore
| Feature               | Mutex                 | Semaphore                    |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Ownership             | Owned by a thread     | No ownership                 |
| Value                 | Binary (0 or 1)       | Can be counting or binary    |
| Use case              | Mutual exclusion      | Resource counting, signaling |
| Unlocking             | Only owner can unlock | Any thread can signal        |
| Synchronization level | Simpler               | More flexible                |

## 17.Variants of pthread_mutex_lock
- pthread_mutex_lock()-Blocks until lock is acquired.
- pthread_mutex_trylock()-Tries to lock but doesn't block if already locked.
- pthread_mutex_timedlock()-Waits for a specific timeout before failing.

## 18.How to create a thread
- Using pthread_create():
```c
#include <pthread.h>
#include <stdio.h>

void* task(void* arg) {
    printf("Hello from thread!\n");
    return NULL;
}

int main() {
    pthread_t tid;
    pthread_create(&tid, NULL, task, NULL);
    pthread_join(tid, NULL);
    return 0;
}
```
## 19.Compilation of a thread
- Compile with the -pthread option:
gcc thread.c -o thread -pthread
- This links the pthread library and ensures proper thread support.

## 20.Arguments of pthead_create 
```c
int pthread_create(
    pthread_t *thread,              // thread identifier
    const pthread_attr_t *attr,     // thread attributes (NULL for default)
    void *(*start_routine)(void *), // function to run
    void *arg                       // argument to function
);
```

## 21.Return value of thread 
- A thread cab return:
    - A pointer value using return.
    - Or use pthread_exit() to return explicitly.
- The value can be collected using pthread_join().

## 22.Working of pthread_mutex_trylock()
- Tries to acquire the lock.
- If the lock is free -> thread locks and continues.
- If the lock is already held -> return EBUSY immediately (non-blocking).

## 23.Application of pthread_mutex_timedlock()
- Used when a thread must wait for the lock only for a fixed time.
- Useful in real-time or timeout-based applications to avoid indefinite blocking.

## 24.What is Mutual Exclusion?
- Mutual exclusion (mutex) means only one thread or process can access the shared resource at a time.
- It prevents:
    - Race conditions.
    - Inconsistent data.
    - Unpredictable behaviour.
- Achieved using mutex locks, semaphores, or atomic instructions.
